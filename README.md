# Auto-Trading-Bot

### Motivation
> My motivation for this project is to make a bot that trades for you. 
> Therefore, you don't need to check the chart yourself and spend your time every day.

### How can I start the bot?
> Same as the other trading systems, this bot also needs a good strategy to get a good profit at the end of the month or week.
> I wrote two strategies by myself for the default option but if you are a trader, absolutely your strategy works better than mine.

### How can I write a strategy?
> If you know Python programming language, write your strategy by getting real-time market data from IEXCloud and access indicators by TAAPI service.
> If you know Pine script, write your strategy and connect it with BVA to let this script access alerts that come from TradingView.
